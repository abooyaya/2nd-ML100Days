    "#### RNN適合的應用場景：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Image classification, where an image is examined and a single determination is made, such as “Daytime picture” versus “Nighttime picture”.\n",
    "This is an example of a one-to-one mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Image captioning, where an image is automatically given a caption based on what is being shown. This can include complex actions, such as: “Fox jumping over dog”.\n",
    "This task requires a one-to-many RNN, where the input is a single image and the output is a phrase consisting of several words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time series prediction, such as the forecasting of a stock price given a history of values.\n",
    "This task involves using a many-to-one RNN, where many previous stock prices are used to predict a single, future price.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Automatic language translation, where the written text or spoken words of one language serves as input, and a different language representing the same text is output.\n",
    "This is an example of a many-to-many RNN, where several words are analyzed as input, and the output is also several words in length.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Natural language processing, such as sentiment analysis in social media posts.\n",
    "Depending on the complexity of the sentiment, this RNN may be of type many-to-one or many-to-many. If, for example, the sentiment is “positive” or “negative”, then there is only a single output. However, if the sentiment is more complex and combined with additional modifiers such as “positive and funny”, “negative and angry”, or “negative and funny” then it would be suitable for a many-to-many implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text classification and sentence completion. RNN is used broadly in text classification, outperforming other well known algorithms such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM).\n",
    "Segmented handwriting recognition and speech recognition systems have also been successfully implemented using RNNs.\n",
